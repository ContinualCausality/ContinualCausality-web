# Program

The bridge's program spans activities from traditional tutorials and software labs on the educational side, invited vision talks and contributed ones based on submitted position papers, to an interactive panel and breakout discussions.

The *tenative* program (subject to minor changes) is as follows: 

#### Day 1

* 8:45: Bridge kickoff (15 min)
* 9:00: Tutorial on continual learning (90 min)
* 10:30: Coffee break (30 min) 
* 11:00: Tutorial on causality (90 min)
* 12:30: Joint lunch (60 min) 
* 13:30: Invited vision talks on the bridge's interface, 3 x 30 min + 10 minute Q\&A (120 min)
	* [Yejin Choi](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~yejin/), University of Washington, Allen Institute for AI 
	* [Christopher Kanan](https://chriskanan.com), University of Rochester
	* [Tobias Gerstenberg](https://cicl.stanford.edu/member/tobias_gerstenberg/), Stanford University 
* 15:30: Coffee break (30 min)
* 16:00: Panel discussion - Panelists TBD (60 min)

#### Day 2
* 8:55: Short opening (5 min)
* 9:00: Software lab on continual learning with [Avalanche](https://avalanche.continualai.org) (90 min)
* 10:30 Coffee break (30 min)
* 11:00: Software lab on causality with [DoWhy](https://py-why.github.io/dowhy) (90 min)
* 12:30: Joint lunch (60 min)
* 13:30: 4 x 10 min contributed short talks based on position paper submissions + 5 min Q\&A each (60min)
* 14:30: Poster session + coffee (60 min)
* 15:30: Interactive community discussion on future challenges in smaller breakout groups (60 min) 
* 16:30: Collection of ideas from breakout session for future formats and bridge wrap-up (30 min)

#### Software Labs 
[Avalanche](https://avalanche.continualai.org): is an End-to-End Continual Learning Library based on PyTorch, born within ContinualAI with the unique goal of providing a shared and collaborative open-source (MIT licensed) codebase for fast prototyping, training and reproducible evaluation of continual learning algorithms. Avalanche has over 1000 stars on Github.  The recent beta version of Avalanche was presented at the CVPR 21 workshop on continual learning in computer vision and is now rapidly picking up on citations in scientific papers (50+ citations according to google scholar within 1 year of publication).

[DoWhy](https://py-why.github.io/dowhy): is a Python library that aims to spark causal thinking and analysis. DoWhy provides a principled four-step interface for causal inference that focuses on explicitly modeling causal assumptions and validating them as much as possible. The key feature of DoWhy is its state-of-the-art refutation API that can automatically test causal assumptions for any estimation method, thus making inference more robust and accessible to non-experts. DoWhy supports estimation of the average causal effect for backdoor, frontdoor, instrumental variable and other identification methods, and estimation of the conditional effect (CATE) through an integration with the EconML library. DoWhy has over 5000 stars on Github and more than 700 forks.
