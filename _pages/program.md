Jorge Mendez-Mendez is a postdoctoral fellow at MIT CSAIL. He received his Ph.D. (2022) and M.S.E. (2018) from the GRASP Lab at the University of Pennsylvania, and his Bachelor's degree (2016) in Electronics Engineering from Universidad Simon Bolivar in Venezuela. His research focuses on creating versatile, intelligent, embodied agents that accumulate knowledge over their lifetimes, leveraging techniques from transfer and multitask learning, modularity and compositionality, reinforcement learning, and task and motion planning. His work has been recognized with an MIT-IBM Distinguished Postdoctoral Fellowship, a third place prize of the Two Sigma Ph.D. Diversity Fellowship, and a Best Paper Award in the Lifelong Machine Learning Workshop (ICML). <br />

[Elina Robeva](https://blockchain.ubc.ca/people/elina-robeva) - University of British Columbia (UBC) <br />
Elina Robeva is an Assistant Professor at the Department of Mathematics in the University of British Columbia. Her research lies at the intersection of mathematical statistics, machine learning, combinatorics, multilinear algebra, and applied algebraic geometry. She particularly enjoys discovering mathematical structure which is inherently responsible for the successful solution to a statistical problem. Most recently she has been working on the theory of linear causal models, structured tensor decompositions, shape-constrained density estimation, and super-resolution imaging. Prior to joining UBC, she spent three years as a Statistics Instructor and an NSF Postdoctoral Fellow in the Department of Mathematics and the Institute for Data, Systems, and Society at MIT. She received her PhD (2016) in mathematics from UC Berkeley under the supervision of Bernd Sturmfels. Her thesis won the Bernard Friedman Memorial prize in applied mathematics. <br />

[Rebecca Herman](https://climateinformaticslab.com/about/) - German Aerospace Center (DLR) <br />
Rebecca Herman is a postdoctoral research scientist at the German Aerospace Center (DLR). She studied climate science and monsoon rainfall during her PhD, and her search for meaningful attribution techniques in the face of limited observational and experimental data led her to the study of causal inference. She is now working on the CausalEarth project with Jakob Runge, focusing on algorithm improvement and effective use of causal inference techniques on time-series climate data. <br />



## Tutorials

[Martin Mundt](https://owll-lab.com) - Technical University of Darmstadt, hessian.AI <br />
Martin Mundt leads the Open World Lifelong Learning lab as an independent research group leader at the Hessian Center for Artificial Intelligence (hessian.AI) and visiting professor at the Technical University of Darmstadt (TU Darmstadt). He is also a board member of directors at the non-profit organization ContinualAI, organizer at Queer in AI, and currently serves as diversity and inclusion chair for AAAI-24 and review process chair for CoLLAs-24. Previously, he has received an M.Sc. in physics (2015) and obtained a PhD in computer science (2021) from Goethe University with distinction and thesis award. The main vision behind Martin’s research is to enable adaptive, robust and sustainable intelligent systems. These lifelong learners are able to behave robustly in novel situations and efficiently include novel experiences, thus providing a sustainable foundation to AI systems for and with humans.  <br />

[Matej Zečević](https://www.matej-zecevic.de) - Technical University of Darmstadt <br />
Matej Zečević is a Ph.D. candidate at the AI/ML lab at TU Darmstadt working with Prof. Kristian Kersting. His research is centered around the integration of causality with AI/ML. As of 2023, Matej has been lecturing causality at university during regular terms, but also in the form of a one-week crash course at the European Summer School for AI (ESSAI). Further, he has held several talks and coding sessions on causality at the International Summer School on Data Science (SDSS) 2022, the Eastern European Machine Learning Summer School (EEML) 2022, the Serbian Machine Learning Workshop (SMLW) 2022, and various reading/discussion groups such as the Chinese Causal Science Community (CCCS) or Learning on Graphs Reading Group (LoGaG). Additionally, he was the core organizer at the NeurIPS 2022 Workshop on neuro Causal and Symbolic AI (nCSI), while also organizing this year's AAAI 2024 Workshop on Large Language Models and Reasoning (LLM-CP). In 2022, Matej also founded the weekly, online Causality Discussion Group (CDG) with over 600 members as of today. <br />
