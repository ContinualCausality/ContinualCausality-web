# Program

The bridge's program will span activities from traditional tutorials and invited vision talks, to real-world application sessions and contributed talks based on submitted papers. In addition there will be an interactive panel and breakout discussions.

The tentative program can be found below and information on confirmed invited speakers is provided further down on this page. The program *at one glance* is as follows:

[Martha White](https://webdocs.cs.ualberta.ca/~whitem/) - University of Alberta and Alberta Machine Intelligence Institute (Amii) <br />
Martha White is an Associate Professor of Computing Science at the University of Alberta and a PI of Amii -- the Alberta Machine Intelligence Institute -- which is one of the top machine learning centres in the world. She holds a Canada CIFAR AI Chair and received IEEE's "AIs 10 to Watch: The Future of AI" award in 2020. She has authored more than 50 papers in top journals and conferences. Martha is an associate editor for TPAMI, and has served as co-program chair for ICLR and area chair for many conferences in AI and ML, including ICML, NeurIPS, AAAI and IJCAI. Her research focus is on developing algorithms for agents continually learning on streams of data, with an emphasis on representation learning and reinforcement learning. <br/>

[Jorge Mendez-Mendez](https://jorge-a-mendez.github.io) - Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) <br />
Jorge Mendez-Mendez is a postdoctoral fellow at MIT CSAIL. He received his Ph.D. (2022) and M.S.E. (2018) from the GRASP Lab at the University of Pennsylvania, and his Bachelor's degree (2016) in Electronics Engineering from Universidad Simon Bolivar in Venezuela. His research focuses on creating versatile, intelligent, embodied agents that accumulate knowledge over their lifetimes, leveraging techniques from transfer and multitask learning, modularity and compositionality, reinforcement learning, and task and motion planning. His work has been recognized with an MIT-IBM Distinguished Postdoctoral Fellowship, a third place prize of the Two Sigma Ph.D. Diversity Fellowship, and a Best Paper Award in the Lifelong Machine Learning Workshop (ICML). <br/>

[Elina Robeva](https://blockchain.ubc.ca/people/elina-robeva) - University of British Columbia (UBC) <br />
Elina Robeva is an Assistant Professor at the Department of Mathematics in the University of British Columbia. Her research lies at the intersection of mathematical statistics, machine learning, combinatorics, multilinear algebra, and applied algebraic geometry. She particularly enjoys discovering mathematical structure which is inherently responsible for the successful solution to a statistical problem. Most recently she has been working on the theory of linear causal models, structured tensor decompositions, shape-constrained density estimation, and super-resolution imaging. Prior to joining UBC, she spent three years as a Statistics Instructor and an NSF Postdoctoral Fellow in the Department of Mathematics and the Institute for Data, Systems, and Society at MIT. She received her PhD (2016) in mathematics from UC Berkeley under the supervision of Bernd Sturmfels. Her thesis won the Bernard Friedman Memorial prize in applied mathematics. <br/>

[Efstratios Gavves](https://ivi.fnwi.uva.nl/vislab/author/efstratios-gavves/) - University of Amsterdam (UVA) <br />
Efstratios Gavves is an Associate Professor with the University of Amsterdam in the Netherlands and Scientific Director of the QUVA Deep Vision Lab. He is a recipient of the prestigious ERC Career Starting Grant 2020 to research on the Computational Learning of Temporality for spatiotemporal sequences. Also, he is a co-founder of Ellogon.AI, a University spinoff and in collaboration with the Dutch Cancer Institute (NKI), with the mission of using AI for pathology and genomics. His research focuses on Causal Computer Vision, specifically how we can achieve Embodied General Intelligence and eventually Cyberphysical AI.
