# Accepted Papers
The [call for participation](http://www.continualcausality.org/cfp/) outlines how to contribute to the vision and actively join the bridge efforts with your submission. Check out the details to get your work accepted! 

Accepted papers from last year's first Continual Causality bridge have been compiled in the [**Proceedings of Machine Learning Research Volume 208**](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v208/).

All accepted papers have further been presented as a poster at the Continual Causality Bridge. In addition, four papers have been selected for additional contributed talks. 

If you have missed the inaugural AAAI-23 Continual Causality Bridge, we, the organizers, have also written a brief article to summarize the event, recap trends and highlight the many great discussions.
