The fields of **causality** and **continual learning** research complementary aspects of human cognition and are
fundamental components of artificial intelligence if it is to reason and generalize in complex environments. On
the one hand, causality theory provides the language, algorithms, and tools to discover and infer cause-and-effect
relationships from data and a partial understanding of a complex system. On the other hand, continual learning
systems learn over time from a continuous stream of data, enable knowledge transfer, and alleviate potentially
malicious interference when distributional shifts are experienced. However, despite some recent interest in bringing
the two fields together, it is still unclear how causal models may describe continuous streams of data and, vice versa,
for continual learning to exploit learned causal structure.


Following the success of our inaugural bridge to bring the fields of continual learning and causality together, the
“Continual Causality” bridge returns again at AAAI-24. In this bridge program, we continue working towards a
unified treatment of these fields and to provide the **space for learning, discussions, and to connect and build a
diverse long-term community.**


To this end, the Continual Causality Bridge invites submissions that present either general positions and visions
of how to link the two fields, outline challenges that need to be overcome, highlight synergies, and propose
tangible future steps or discuss first practical approaches and solutions to relevant problems. **Submissions of all
papers should be up to four pages (excluding references, and without appendices) in the AAAI format. The
submission deadline is November 24, 2023 (AOE).** All submissions will be managed through [OpenReview](https://openreview.net/group?id=AAAI.org/2024/Bridge/CCBridge) and
will later be collected in a Proceedings of Machine Learning Research (PMLR) volume.


**The review process is double-blind, so submissions should be anonymized.** As our bridge’s focus is on building a
long-term community, the review process will be light and inclusive, focusing primarily on technical correctness as
a means of evaluation.


Our vision is for prospective community members to voice diverse views that have the potential to advance AI
through an ongoing cross-disciplinary exchange. We therefore have no strict constraints on the exact sub-topics of
submissions, as long as they target the overall goal of bridging the fields. Submissions are free to focus on a single
particularly interesting synergy, take an angle from a specific scientific discipline, or sketch a grander view. To
provide some suggestions, contributions could center around the following aspects, including but not limited to:

* Continual learning and exploitation of causal systems in dynamic non-stationary environments.
* Catastrophic interference and knowledge transfer in learning causal models in the context of continuous streams of data.
* Effective ways for causal structure to aid in leveraging the accumulated knowledge of a continual learning system.
* Leveraging causal tools to interpret distributional shifts in continual learning.
* Next generation benchmarks that go beyond repurposing of existing datasets to adequately support the above items and further essential research questions towards a symbiosis of continual learning and causality.
